# Executive Summary

**Structured Intelligence** introduces a new computational paradigm for artificial general intelligence (AGI), replacing the traditional transformer-based, token-prediction models. By focusing on world-based reasoning, structured knowledge, and multi-agent collaboration, Structured Intelligence overcomes the limitations of the current AI systems.

Key Components:
- **SPU (Structured Processing Unit)**: A processor optimized for reasoning, not matrix multiplication.
- **World-OS**: A world-model kernel defining entities, relations, rules, and causality.
- **StructureOS**: An operating system that orchestrates reasoning processes, agent coordination, and energy regulation.
- **SEF (Structural Energy Framework)**: A cognitive energy model that regulates reasoning depth and stability.
- **Multi-Agent SPU Framework**: A multi-agent system designed for collaborative cognition.
- **KnowledgeOps**: A knowledge management system enabling dynamic updates and governance of structured world models.

This paradigm is designed to be safe, scalable, and interpretable, offering a foundation for true AGI.
