# Structured Intelligence: A New Paradigm for AGI

## Abstract

The current AI paradigm, based on large language models (LLMs) and GPU-accelerated matrix computation, has reached its limits. These systems lack the ability to reason in structured, world-aware ways. **Structured Intelligence** introduces a new paradigm for AGI that replaces token-based statistical prediction with world-based, rule-grounded reasoning. 

## Core Components

- **SPU (Structured Processing Unit)**: A new processor designed for reasoning, not matrix multiplication.
- **World-OS**: A world-model kernel that defines entities, relations, rules, and causality.
- **StructureOS**: An intelligence operating system that orchestrates reasoning processes, agent collaboration, and cognitive safety.
- **SEF (Structural Energy Framework)**: A cognitive energy model for regulating reasoning depth and stability.
- **Multi-Agent SPU Framework**: A collaborative cognition architecture for AGI.
- **KnowledgeOps**: A knowledge operating system designed for rule-level updates and world evolution.

## Conclusion

Structured Intelligence enables AGI that is:
- **World-consistent**
- **Causally grounded**
- **Energy-efficient**
- **Multi-agent and scalable**
