## Structural Energy Framework (SEF)

SEF regulates reasoning depth, domain activation, and cognitive stability. We model the instantaneous energy state as:

```math
E_s(t) = \alpha C_t + \beta R_t + \gamma D_t + \delta S_t + \lambda L_t

## Where:
- \( \alpha, \beta, \gamma, \delta, \lambda \) are system-specific cost coefficients.
- \( C_t \) is the structural complexity at time \( t \).
- \( R_t \) is the number of active relational edges.
- \( D_t \) is the number of domains activated.
- \( S_t \) is the schema complexity at time \( t \).
- \( L_t \) is the reasoning depth at time \( t \).
