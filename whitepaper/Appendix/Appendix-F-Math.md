## Structural Energy Framework (SEF)

SEF regulates reasoning depth, domain activation, and cognitive stability. We model the instantaneous energy state as:

```math
E_s(t) = \alpha C_t + \beta R_t + \gamma D_t + \delta S_t + \lambda L_t

Where:

𝛼
,
𝛽

𝛾

𝛿

𝜆
α,β,γ,δ,λ are system-specific cost coefficients.

𝐶

 is the structural complexity at time

𝑅

 is the number of active relational edges.
