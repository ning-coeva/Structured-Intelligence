# SPU ISA (Structured Intelligence Instruction Set)

The SPU ISA defines the primitive cognitive operations executable by the Structured Processing Unit. These instructions operate on world structures such as objects, relations, schemas, world-state, causal graphs, and energy allocations, instead of tensors or numbers.
