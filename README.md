# Structured Intelligence

**A Post-Transformer Computing Paradigm for AGI**

---

## Overview

The current AI paradigm—dominated by transformer-based large language models and GPU-accelerated matrix computation—has reached fundamental conceptual and physical limits.

This repository presents **Structured Intelligence**:  
a new, world-based computational paradigm for artificial general intelligence (AGI).

Structured Intelligence replaces token-based statistical prediction with:

- explicit world models  
- rule-grounded reasoning  
- causal structure  
- multi-agent collaboration  
- energy-regulated cognition  
- mechanistic safety guarantees  

This is not a model.  
It is a **complete intelligence computing stack**.

## Core Components

Structured Intelligence is built on the following layers:

- **SPU (Structured Processing Unit)**  
  A processor designed for reasoning, not matrix multiplication.

- **World-OS**  
  A world-model kernel defining entities, relations, transitions, causality, and domain logic.

- **StructureOS**  
  An intelligence operating system orchestrating reasoning processes, agents, energy, memory, and safety.

- **SEF (Structural Energy Framework)**  
  A cognitive energy model regulating reasoning depth, stability, and prioritization.

- **Multi-Agent SPU Framework**  
  Collaborative cognition via specialized agents (Planner, Analyst, Critic, Explorer, Safety, Synthesizer).

- **KnowledgeOps**  
  A structured knowledge operating system for rule-level updates, governance, and world evolution.

- **SPU Cloud**  
  A distributed world-execution platform for large-scale reasoning and simulation.

## Why Structured Intelligence

Structured Intelligence enables:

- world-consistent reasoning  
- causal correctness  
- multi-domain logic  
- zero-retraining knowledge updates  
- mechanistic safety (not prompt-based filtering)  
- energy-efficient, scalable intelligence  
- interpretable and governable AGI systems  

It defines a **post-transformer, post-GPU** computing paradigm.

## Status

- **Version:** v1.0  
- **Purpose:** Research, architecture specification, and paradigm definition  
- **License:** TBD  

This repository is intended as a **time-axis milestone** for the Structured Intelligence paradigm.

## Final Note

> Intelligence is not an emergent accident of scale.  
> It is a system that can be engineered.

Structured Intelligence is that system.
